TRIM Function

I add a new line heere

The TRIM function removes leading and trailing characters from a character string.
trim-type
specifies whether characters are to be trimmed from the leading end (LEADING),
trailing end (TRAILING), or both ends (BOTH) of trim-source. If you omit trimtype,
the default is BOTH.
trim_char
is an SQL character value expression and specifies the character to be trimmed
from trim-source. trim_char has a maximum length of 1. If you omit
trim_char, SQL trims blanks (' ') from trim-source.
trim-source
is an SQL character value expression and specifies the string from which to trim
characters. See Character Value Expressions on page 6-39.
